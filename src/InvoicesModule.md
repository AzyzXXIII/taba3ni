## ðŸ’¡ Advanced PDF Generation (Optional):

If you want native PDF generation instead of HTML, install `jsPDF`:

```bash
npm install jspdf jspdf-autotable
```

Then update `handleDownloadPDF()`:

```typescript
import jsPDF from "jspdf";
import "jspdf-autotable";

const handleDownloadPDF = () => {
  const doc = new jsPDF();

  // Add content to PDF
  doc.setFontSize(20);
  doc.text("INVOICE", 105, 20, { align: "center" });

  // Add items table
  doc.autoTable({
    head: [["Description", "Qty", "Price", "Total"]],
    body: invoice.items.map((item) => [
      item.name,
      item.quantity,
      `${item.price} TND`,
      `${item.total} TND`,
    ]),
  });

  // Save
  doc.save(`Invoice_${invoice.invoiceNumber}.pdf`);
