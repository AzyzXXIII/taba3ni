## 💡 **Next Steps - API Integration**

When you're ready to connect to a real backend:

```typescript
// Example API calls to add:

// 1. Fetch all clients
const getClients = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/clients");
  return response.json();
};

// 2. Create client
const createClient = async (clientData) => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/clients", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(clientData),
  });
  return response.json();
};

// 3. Update client
const updateClient = async (id, clientData) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/clients/${id}`, {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(clientData),
  });
  return response.json();
};

// 4. Delete client
const deleteClient = async (id) => {
  await fetch(`/api/clients/${id}`, { method: "DELETE" });
};
```
